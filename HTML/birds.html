        <h2>Bird Owners</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          Pet birds have been cherished companions for centuries, with evidence of domestication dating back to ancient
          Egypt and Rome. Their vibrant colors, intelligence, and ability to mimic sounds have made them popular pets
          around the world. Today, birds such as parrots, canaries, and finches continue to bring joy and companionship
          to households, offering unique social and emotional bonds for their owners.</p>

        <h3>Relational needs</h3>
        <p>Birds are very intriguing creatures as they can range from birds as small as a Cuban bee hummingbird (about
          two inches long and a little over 1/20 of an ounce) to as large as an ostrich. While most birds fly, there are
          some that don't. Birds are amazing and each breed is unique in its own way, particularly when it comes to
          their relational needs and well-being. Unfortunately, birds can experience sadness and depression just like
          humans. A number of root causes may be responsible for your bird's depression such as an illness (either
          physical or mental), losing its companion, or increasingly becoming bored. Some signs to help identify if your
          bird is experiencing depression may include the following:
        <ul>
          <li>Reduced appetite</li>
          <li>Becoming increasingly irritable</li>
          <li>Aggressive behavior</li>
          <li>Songs have a different, more solemn tone </li>
        </ul>

        </p>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Be sure to tell your veterinarian if you see signs of any of these symptoms.
          Just like many illnesses,
          identifying and treating the symptoms earlier may drastically increase the lifespan of your birdie! </h3>
